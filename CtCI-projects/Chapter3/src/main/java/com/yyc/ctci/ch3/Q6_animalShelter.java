/**
 * An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in,
 * first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of
 * all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a
 * cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which
 * specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system
 * and implement operations such as "enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat".
 * You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.<br><br>
 * 
 * <b>Note</b><br>
 * A queue uses FIFO (first-in first-out) ordering.<br>
 * It uses the following operations:
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>add(item): Add an item to the end of the list.</li>
 * 		<li>remove(): Remove the first item in the list.</li>
 * 		<li>peek(): Return the top of the queue.</li>
 * 		<li>isEmpty(): Return true if and only if the queue is empty.</li>
 * </ul>
